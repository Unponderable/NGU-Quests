# NGU Quests
Unponderable's Questing Script for NGU Idle
Supports NGU Idle version 0.423

Script will endlessly farm quests and the corresponding items.


Prerequisites:
 Questing unlocked
 Adequate Inventory Space to handle various quest items
 Ability to one-shot all unlocked questing zones

 I strongly suggest wearing Quest Drops and Respawn accessories for maximum effectiveness
 I also suggest filtering <= 1K Boosts and MacGuffins unless you are confident in your auto-boost/merge.

Instructions for Questing: 
1. Run the script.
2. With the NGU window focused and fully visible in your screen, use ***Ctrl+j*** to begin the script.
3. Press Esc at any time to exit.
